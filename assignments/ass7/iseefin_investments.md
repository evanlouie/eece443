## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Software Development Plan is to gather all information necessary to control the project. It describes the approach to the development of the software and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the development effort.

The following people use the *Software Development Plan*:

* The **project manager** uses it to plan the project schedule and resource needs, and to track progress against the schedule.

* **Project team members** use it to understand what they need to do, when they need to do it, and what other activities they are dependent upon.

### 1.2 Scope
This Software Development Plan describes the overall plan to be used by the ISeeFin project, including deployment of the product. The details of the individual iterations will be described in the Iteration Plans.
The plans as outlined in this document are based upon the product requirements as defined in the *Use Case Document*.

### 1.5 Overview
This Software Development Plan contains the following information:

**Project Overview** — provides a description of the project's purpose, scope, and objectives.  It also defines the deliverables that the project is expected to deliver.

**Project Organization** — describes the organizational structure of the project team.

**Management Process** — explains the estimated cost and schedule, defines the major phases and milestones for the project, and describes how the project will be monitored.

**Applicable Plans and Guidelines** — provides an overview of the software development process, including methods, tools and techniques to be followed.

## 2. Project Overview
### 2.1 	Project Purpose, Scope, and Objectives
We envisage building and launching in the market a software tool to support Investment Clubs. An investment club is a group of persons who pool their financial resources (i.e., cash) in order to acquire and manage collectively a portfolio of securities (such as stocks, or bonds, or other publicly traded financial instruments)..


### 2.2  Assumptions and Constraints
Version 1.0 of the system must be fully deployed and operational by the end of **Q3 2015**

### 2.3 Project Deliverables
* Business Use Cases
* Business Use Case Survey
* Glossary
* Supplementary Specifications
* Creative Design Briefs
* Navigation Map
* User Interface Prototype
* Use Case Survey
* Data Model
* Design Model
* Database Design
* Software Architecture Document
* Implementation Subsystem
* Test Package
* Change Requests
* Test Summary

### 2.4 Evolution of the Software Development Plan
The Software Development Plan will be revised prior to the start of each Iteration phase.

Version | Phase | Target Date
:----   | :---- | ------------:
2 | Inception   | June 24, 2014
3 | Elaboration | August 5, 2014
4.1 | Construction Iteration 1 | September 20, 2014
4.2 | Construction Iteration 2 | October 10, 2014
4.3 | Construction Iteration 3 | October 30, 2014
4.4 | Construction Iteration 4 | November 10, 2014
4.5 | Construction Iteration 5 | December 1, 2014
5 | Transition | January 8, 2014

## 3. Project Organization
### 3.1 Organizational Structure
The team will maintain a flat management structure in order to maintain agility and ease communication across the team.  However, there will be key roles deligated to certain people to maintain a single point of communication for important jobs as well as maintain accountability for milestones (see 3.3).

### 3.2 External Interfaces
The project will maintain largely in-house and within the one individual development team.  However input and feedback will be taken into account from investors and end-user asked to test the system.

### 3.3 Roles and Responsibilities

## 4. Management Process
### 4.1 Project Estimates
The construction phase it estimated to take approximately 3000 Person-Hours to complete (refer to Use-Case Point Analysis of Appendix A).  Add to this a minimum of 1000 Person-Hours to test and deploy, the project will take approximately 4000 Person-Hours and cost
